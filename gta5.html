<p id="first"><br>Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It was released on 17 September 2013 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, on 18 November 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and on 14 April 2015 for Microsoft Windows. It is the first main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series since 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story follows three criminals and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from a government agency. The open world design lets players freely roam San Andreas' open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.</p><br>
<h3 id="first"><i>Gameplay</i></h3><br>
<p id="first">Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game[2] played from either a first-person[3][b] or third-person view.[4] Players complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story.[5] Outside of missions, players may freely roam the open world. Composed of the San Andreas open countryside area and the fictional city of Los Santos, the world is much larger in area than earlier entries in the series.[6][c] It may be fully explored after the game's beginning without restriction, although story progress unlocks more gameplay content.[8]
The player character crouched behind a vehicle while in combat. The head-up display elements are visible on-screen.
Players may take cover behind objects during firefights to avoid taking damage from enemies.
