<h4 id="third"><i>You Have Been Hacked!</i></h4>
<p id="first"><br>Watch Dogs (stylized as WATCH_DOGS) is an action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It was released worldwide on 27 May 2014 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One, while a Wii U version was released in November 2014. Set within a fictionalized version of Chicago, Illinois, the single-player story follows a hacker and his efforts to seek revenge after the killing of his niece. The open world design lets players freely roam the urban city, suburbs, open countryside, and run-down neighborhoods of Chicago.</p><br>
<h3 id="first"><i>Gameplay</i></h3><br>
<p id="first">In the main game, players take control of Aiden Pearce, a vigilante who can hack into various electronic devices tied to the city's central operating system (ctOS), allowing various methods for the player to solve numerous objectives.[3] The hacking mechanic in the game is performed directly from Aiden's in-game smartphone. The phone is also equipped with applications that interact directly with the environment around the player; for example, players can hack into NPC's phones to retrieve bank data and steal funds as well as unlock new cars, weapons, and in-game music, or they can hack into traffic lights to cause collisions. Players can stop trains, raise security barriers, and black out the entire city and can slow down time to shoot.[4]</p><br>
