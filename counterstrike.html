<h2 id="first">Global Offensive</h2>
<p id="first">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (colloquially referred to as CS:GO) is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Hidden Path Entertainment and Valve Corporation. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series, and was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, with the Linux version being released in September 2014. Cross-platform multiplayer was planned between Windows, OS X, Linux, and PlayStation 3 players, <br>but was ultimately limited to the computer versions<br> because of the difference in update frequency between systems.</p><br>
<h3 id="first"><i>Gameplay</i></h3><br>
<p id="first">The gameplay in Global Offensive is similar to that of the previous games in the Counter-Strike series in the sense that it is an objective-based multiplayer first-person shooter featuring two teams. The two teams consist of the Terrorists and the Counter Terrorists, with both teams having different purposes: the Terrorists' being to access a bombsite (specified locations on the game's map) and plant a bomb and have it explode or to protect the hostages, and the Counter-Terrorists' being to prevent the bomb from being planted or to defuse the bomb, or to rescue the aforementioned hostages, depending on the gamemode.[1][2] At the end of each round, players are rewarded with in-game currency with which they can purchase new guns and equipment for the coming rounds. The amount that is awarded to each individual is based on their performance in the previous round. Winning rounds results in more money than losing, and completing objectives such as killing enemy players gives cash bonuses.[1] Uncooperative actions, such as killing teammates, will result in a penalty</p><br>
